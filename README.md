Project by: Jacobus George van Dyk (vandyk@sun.ac.za, SU number: 20790147)

Project supervised by: Prof Steven M. Bradshaw (smb@sun.ac.za)

Department of Process Engineering, Stellenbosch University, 2022.

**Project Description and Objectives:**

Many methods have been developed for controlling non-linear systems, which include controller design based on linearised models, adaptive control, and non-linear model predictive control. The objective of this project is to investigate the performance of a new method developed by Skogestad and co-workers (Zotică et al., 2020) that uses transformed manipulated variables for linearisation, decoupling, and perfect steady state disturbance rejection.

**Project Outcome and Deliverables**

The following requirements must be met for the project to be considered successful:
• Successful dynamic modelling of two non-linear processes.
• Successful implementation of transformed manipulated variable control on the processes.
• Successful investigation of the performance of the novel control strategy and appropriate comparison with other methods.

**Project Characteristics and Requirements**

1) **Applicability to Chemical Engineering:**

Dynamic modelling and control of nonlinear processes are significant chemical engineering activities.
